Project Notes:
project-control is a group of tasks used in the creation of an Angular app.
These are node tasks used during development

This project contain helper tasks (utilities) for developing Angular applications such as:
1) Application version and technology versions used in the app
2) Publishing to NPM after committing to Git
3) Base64 integration

Before Debugging: Use Build:Watch to interactively make changes while debugging

When do we need to run the ng-packagr?
You only need to use the ng-packagr when creating a module that will be imported into an Angular application
such as ngx-modelling

taskNpmPublish: to test, make sure you have a local commit ready to be published
