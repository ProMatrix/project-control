Project Notes:
project-control is a group of tasks used in the creation of an Angular app.
These are node tasks used during development

This project contain helper tasks (utilities) for developing Angular applications such as:
1) Application version and technology versions used in the app
2) Publishing to NPM after committing to Git
3) Base64 integration

Before Debugging: Run Build:Watch to interactively make changes while debugging

When do we need to run the ng-packagr?
You only need to use the ng-packagr when creating a module that will be imported into an Angular application
such as ngx-modelling

taskNpmPublish: to test, make sure you have a local commit ready to be published
if you don't want to publish, but just test the git-hook, you can change testOnly to true

Note: before publishing, you need to log in...

use: npm whoami
to check if you are logged in...
if not...

make sure to setup: 2 factor authentication:
https://docs.npmjs.com/configuring-two-factor-authentication

then...
use: npm login

Ways to debug TaskNpmPublish:
Debug: Debug:Git-Hook

    "Debug:Git-Hook": "node ./git-hooks/pre-push.js"

Launch: npm project-control

    Make sure arguments are the same as in pre-push.ts

To update project without invoking the publish...
comment out the: const noop = new TaskNpmPublish(false, ... in the pre-push.ts file
